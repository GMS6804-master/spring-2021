(see Section 1.5 for additional details about submitting data to GenBank.)

*****************************************************************************

  GenBank Release 138.0 is a release of sequence data by NCBI in the GenBank
flatfile format.  GenBank is a component of a tri-partite, international
collaboration of sequence databases in the U.S., Europe, and Japan.  The
collaborating databases in Europe are the European Molecular Biology Laboratory
(EMBL) at Hinxton Hall, UK, and the DNA Database of Japan (DDBJ) in Mishima,
Japan.  Patent sequences are incorporated through arrangements with the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and via the collaborating international
databases from other international patent offices.  The database is converted
to various output formats, including the Flat File and Abstract Syntax Notation 1
(ASN.1) versions.  The ASN.1 and Flat File forms of the data are available at
NCBI's anonymous FTP server: ftp.ncbi.nih.gov .

1.2 Cutoff Date

  This full release, 138.0, incorporates data available to the collaborating
databases as of October 20, 2003.  For more recent data, users are advised to:

  o Download GenBank Incremental Update (GIU) files by anonymous FTP from NCBI:

	ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/ncbi-asn1/daily-nc (ASN.1 format)
	ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/daily-nc   (flatfile format)

    Mirrors of the GenBank FTP site at the NCBI are available from the San Diego
    Supercomputer Center and the University of Indiana:

	ftp://genbank.sdsc.edu/pub
	ftp://bio-mirror.net/biomirror/genbank/

    Some users who experience slow FTP transfers of large files might realize
    an improvement in transfer rates from these alternate sites when traffic at
    the NCBI is high.

  o Use the interactive Network-Entrez or Web-Entrez applications to query
    the 'Entrez: Nucleotides' database (see Section 6.4 of this document).

1.3 Important Changes in Release 138.0

1.3.1 Organizational changes

  The total number of sequence data files increased by 29 with this release:

  - the EST division is now comprised of 279 files (+9)
  - the GSS division is now comprised of 102 files (+18)
  - the ROD division is now comprised of 10  files (+1)
  - the VRT division is now comprised of 4   files (+1)

  Updates to a significant number of HTC sequences has resulted in a
  *decrease* in the overall number of HTC sequence files, from four
  to three. The changes reduced the sizes of the records, such that
  they now fit into only three files.

1.3.2 BASECOUNT line dropped

  The BASECOUNT line of the GenBank flatfile format provides totals for
the number of A, T, G, C, and 'other' basepairs that are present within
the sequence of a database record. For example:

LOCUS       AY244763                5686 bp    DNA     linear   BCT 10-APR-2003
DEFINITION  Rhodococcus sp. DS7 cysDNCQ operon, complete sequence.
ACCESSION   AY244763
VERSION     AY244763.1  GI:29725657
....
BASE COUNT     1137 a   1661 c   1821 g   1066 t      1 others
ORIGIN      
        1 cgcggtttgt gacgtctgat tgccggtcat tgacctttgg gtagaacgag ttctattctg
       61 tgattgcgtt caatttagaa ccagtccggt acataaatgt accgatgcgg aaatggtgtt
....
     5281 tgtcagctcg gtgtctggng gcgaggctaa gcaccaacgg cttcggtagc agaaccacat

  This information is computationally expensive to produce for very large
sequences, and for sequences in the CON division. In the CON division case,
a record might be comprised of 'pointers' to hundreds, or even thousands,
of underlying GenBank records. So to calculate the BASECOUNT line content,
retrievals of sequence data for those many records must be performed. This
can noticeably impact the response time for flatfile generation within the
Entrez application.

As of this October 2003 GenBank Release (138.0), the BASECOUNT linetype
is no longer present in GenBank Release and GenBank Update products.

Depending on demand, a display option might be implemented in Entrez which
allows users to choose to have BASECOUNT shown.

1.3.3 New oriT feature

  As of this October 2003 Release 138.0, a new feature key (oriT) is be
legal for the feature table:

	Feature Key            oriT

	Definition             origin of transfer; region of a DNA molecule where transfer is
                               initiated during the process of conjugation or mobilization.

	Mandatory qualifiers:  None

	Optional Qualifiers:   /bound_moiety="text"
                               /citation=[number]
                               /db_xref="<database>:<identifier>"
                               /direction=value
                               /evidence=<evidence_value>
                               /gene="text"
                               /label=feature_label
                               /locus_tag="text" (single token)
                               /map="text"
                               /note="text"
                               /rpt_family="text"
                               /rpt_type=<repeat_type>
                               /rpt_unit=<feature_label>
                               /standard_name="text"
                               /usedin=accnum:feature_label

	Molecule Scope:        DNA

	Comments:              rep_origin should be used for origins of replication; /direction
                               has legal values RIGHT, LEFT and BOTH, however only RIGHT and LEFT
                               are valid when used in conjunction with the oriT feature; origins
                               of transfer can be present in the chromosome; plasmids can contain
                               multiple origins of transfer

1.3.4 New /ecotype qualifier

  As of this October 2003 GenBank Release 138.0, a new source feature
qualifier called /ecotype is legal. The definition for /ecotype is:

        Qualifier       /ecotype=    
        Definition      A distinct population of organisms of a
                        widespread species that has adapted
                        genetically to its own local habitat.
                        Nevertheless, they can still reproduce
                        with members of other ecotypes of the
                        same species.
        Value format    "text"
        Example         /ecotype="Columbia"

        Comment         'Ecotype' is often applied to standard
                        genetic stocks of Arabidopsis thaliana,
                        but it can be applied to any organism,
                        especially sessile organisms like plants.


1.3.5 Change to value format of /rpt_unit

  As of this October 2003 Release 138.0, the value-format of the /rpt_unit
qualifier has been changed to allow 'text' . The previously documented
format was:

	Value format    <feature_label>  or  <base_range>
	Example         /rpt_unit=Alu_rpt1
	                /rpt_unit=202..245
	Comment         used to indicate feature which defines (or base range of) the
	                repeat unit of which a repeat region is made

  However, a very common value for /rpt_unit is a literal sequence
string that represents the repeating unit(s). For example:

	/rpt_unit=ta
	/rpt_unit=ac;ag

So the format of this qualifier has been changed to:

	Value format    "text"  or  <feature_label>  or  <base_range>

Existing feature label and base range values are now presented as
text values.

1.3.6 New operon feature

  Starting with this October 2003 Release 138.0, a new type of feature 
is legal for the feature table:

	Feature Key:           operon

	Definition:            region containing polycistronic transcripts
                               and regulatory sequences containing genes
                               that encode enzymes that are in the same
                               metabolic pathway  

	Mandatory qualifiers:  /operon

	Optional qualifiers:   /allele="text"
                               /citation=[number]
                               /db_xref="<database>:<identifier>"
                               /evidence=<evidence_value>
                               /function="text"
                               /operon="text"
                               /label=feature_label
                               /locus_tag="text" (single token)
                               /map="text"
                               /note="text"
                               /product="text"
                               /pseudo
                               /phenotype="text"
                               /standard_name="text"
                               /usedin=accnum:feature_label

  In bacteria, many genes encoding for specific biosynthetic pathways are
transcribed in polycistronic operons. It has been challenging to reflect
this biology within the GenBank flatfile format. GenBank has been using
a gene feature that spans the entire regulatory region and all of the coding
regions and then gene features corresponding to the individual genes spaning
the coding genes.

  The new operon feature will simplify the annotation of cases like these.

1.3.7 [er] prefix for JOURNAL line

  As of this October 2003 Release 138.0, a new prefix is legal for the
JOURNAL line:  [er] .

  This prefix is an abbreviation for Electronic Resource, which is a 
term that describes journal articles that are available on-line.

  In 1999, an interim 'Online Publication' REFERENCE format was adopted for
use at GenBank in order to cite articles appearing only electronically:

      REFERENCE   1  (bases 1 to 2858)
        AUTHORS   Smith, J.
        TITLE     Cloning and expression of a phospholipase gene
        JOURNAL   Online Publication
        REMARK    Online-Journal-name; Article Identifier; URL

  In subsequent years, no standards for citing on-line journal articles
have emerged from library organizations.

  One such library organization (National Library of Medicine, NIH) is now
assigning identifiers (Medline UIs and PubMed Ids) to articles published
on-line, and it is presenting these articles in a manner that is identical
to print-journal articles. For example:

      REFERENCE   1
        AUTHORS   Haas,B.J., Volfovsky,N., Town,C.D., Troukhan,M., Alexandrov,N.,
                  Feldmann,K.A., Flavell,R.B., White,O. and Salzberg,S.L.
        TITLE     Full-length messenger RNA sequences greatly improve genome
                  annotation
        JOURNAL   Genome Biol. 3 (6), RESEARCH0029 (2002)
        MEDLINE   22088475
         PUBMED   12093376

  Although these citations may contain journal abbreviations, volume numbers,
issue/part/supplement numbers, pages, and year (just like a print-journal
citation), there is no guarantee that the contents of these fields will be 
comparable to those of print-journal citations.

  In the case above, although the page number is a bit unusual
("RESEARCH0029"), software that processes the JOURNAL line would probably
still be able to parse its contents. But there is also a possibility that
these fields could contain unusual characters (embedded spaces, commas,
parentheses), and possibly even URLs. So the presence of [er] :

        JOURNAL   [er] Genome Biol. 3 (6), RESEARCH0029 (2002)

will act as a warning (primarily to software) that the contents of the
JOURNAL line might not be as parsable as a print-journal JOURNAL line.

1.3.8 GSS File Header Problem

  GSS sequences at GenBank are maintained in one of two different systems,
depending on their origin. One recent change to release processing involves
the parallelization of the dumps from those systems. Because the second dump
(for example) has no prior knowledge of exactly how many GSS files will be
dumped from the first, it doesn't know how to number it's own output files.

  There is thus a discrepancy between the filenames and file headers of eleven
GSS flatfiles in Release 138.0. Consider the gbgss74.seq file:

GBGSS1.SEQ           Genetic Sequence Data Bank
                           October 15 2003

                NCBI-GenBank Flat File Release 138.0

                           GSS Sequences (Part 1)

   87880 loci,    66457089 bases, from    87880 reported sequences

  Here, the filename and part number in the header is "1", though the file
has been renamed as "92" based on the files dumped from the other system.

  We will work to resolve this discrepancy in future releases, but the
priority is certainly much lower than many other tasks.

1.4 Upcoming Changes

1.4.1 **Sequence Length Limitation To Be Removed In June 2004**

  At the May 2003 collaborative meeting among representatives of GenBank,
EMBL, and DDBJ, it was decided that the 350 kilobase limit on the sequence
length of database records will be removed as of June 2004.

  Individual, complete sequences are currently expected to be a maximum
of 350 kbp in length. One major reason for the existence of this limit is
as an aid to users of sequence analysis software, some of which might not
be capable of processing megabase-scale sequences.

  However, very significant exceptions to the 350 kbp limit have existed
for several years; Phase 1 (unordered, unoriented) and Phase 2 (ordered,
oriented) high-throughput genomic sequences (HTGS) generated by efforts
such as the Human Genome Project; large dispersed eukaryotic genes with
an intron/exon structure that spans more than 350 kbp; and sequences
which result from assemblies of Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) project data.

  Given these exceptions, and the technological advances which have made
large-scale sequencing practical for an increasing number of researchers,
the collaboration has decided that the 350 kbp limit must be removed.

  As of June 2004, the length of database sequences will be limited only
by the natural structures of an organism's genome. For example, a single
record might be used to represent all of human chromosome 1, which is
approximately 245 Mbp in length.

  Software developers for some of the larger commercial sequence analysis
packages were recently asked what timeframe would be appropriate for this
change. Answers ranged from "immediately", to "several months", to "one year".
So the one-year timeframe was selected, to provide ample time to implement
changes which megabase-scale sequences may require.

  Some sample records with very large sequences have been made available
so that developers can begin to test their software modifications:

	ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/LargeSeqs

  Many changes are expected after the removal of the length limit. For 
example, complete bacterial genomes (typically on the order of several
megabases) will be re-assembled into single sequence records. The submission
process for such genomes will become much more streamlined, since database
staff will no longer have to split the genomes into pieces. BLAST services
will be enchanced, so that hits reported within very large sequences will
be presented in a meaningful context.

  All such changes will be discussed more fully in future release notes,
the NCBI newsletter, and the GenBank newsgroup.

1.4.2 Accession format of WGS records

  Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) sequences utilize an accession number format which
is different from those used for non-WGS GenBank sequences. This format is
referred to as 4 + 2 + 6, and is comprised of:

  - a 4-letter WGS project code
  - a 2-digit assembly-version number
  - a 6 (and sometimes 7) digit sequence number

  Because of their unique nature, WGS sequences are kept separate from other
GenBank products:

	ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/wgs

  For example, sequences much larger than the current 350 kbp limit can be
generated during the WGS assembly phase. In addition, there is no tracking
of nucleotide sequences from one assembly to the next. So the accessions
of one:

	AAAB01000001
	AAAB01000002
	AAAB01000003
	....

are not necessarily related in any way to those of the next assembly:

	AAAB02000001
	AAAB02000002
	AAAB02000003
	....

  When a WGS project is completed, it is possible that the submittors may chose
to submit a single finished WGS sequence with a 4 + 2 + 6 accession, at which
point it could appear in the non-WGS portion of GenBank.

  Alternately, the submittors might chose to submit the completed genome via
a non-WGS method, in which case a de-novo non-WGS accession would be assigned.
That record would then have one or more 2 + 4 + 6 WGS accessions as
secondary accessions.

  Both scenarios are possible, especially after the 350 kbp sequence length
restriction is lifted. So we felt it was important to alert users that
WGS accessions may eventually be encountered in the non-WGS portion of
of GenBank, as primary or secondary accession numbers.

1.5 Request for Direct Submission of Sequence Data

  A successful GenBank requires that sequence data enter the database as
soon as possible after publication, that the annotations be as complete as
possible, and that the sequence and annotation data be accurate. All
three of these requirements are best met if authors of sequence data
submit their data directly to GenBank in a usable form. It is especially
important that these submissions be in computer-readable form.

  GenBank must rely on direct author submission of data to ensure that
it achieves its goals of completeness, accuracy, and timeliness. To
assist researchers in entering their own sequence data, GenBank
provides a WWW submission tool called BankIt, as well as a stand-alone
software package called Sequin. BankIt and Sequin are both easy-to-use
programs that enable authors to enter a sequence, annotate it, and
submit it to GenBank.  Through the international collaboration of DNA
sequence databases, GenBank submissions are forwarded daily for inclusion
in the EMBL and DDBJ databases.

  SEQUIN.  Sequin is an interactive, graphically-oriented program based
on screen forms and controlled vocabularies that guides you through the
process of entering your sequence and providing biological and
bibliographic annotation.  Sequin is designed to simplify the sequence submission
process, and to provide increased data handling capabilities to accomodate
very long sequences, complex annotations, and robust error checking.  E-mail
the completed submission file to : gb-sub@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

  Sequin is provided for Macintosh, PC/Windows, UNIX and VMS computers.
It is available by annonymous ftp from ftp.ncbi.nih.gov; login as
anonymous and use your e-mail address as the password. It is located in
the sequin directory. Or direct your web browser to this URL:

	ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/sequin

  BANKIT.  BankIt provides a simple forms approach for submitting your
sequence and descriptive information to GenBank.  Your submission will
be submitted directly to GenBank via the World Wide Web, and
immediately forwarded for inclusion in the EMBL and DDBJ databases.
BankIt may be used with Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other common
WWW clients. You can access BankIt from GenBank's home page:   

	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/

  AUTHORIN.  Authorin sequence submissions are no longer accepted by
GenBank, and the Authorin application is no longer distributed by NCBI.  

  If you have questions about GenBank submissions or any of the data
submission tools, contact NCBI at: info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov or 301-496-2475.

2.1 Overview

  GenBank releases consist of a set of ASCII text files, most of which
contain sequence data. A few supplemental "index" files are also supplied,
containing comprehensive lists of author names, journal citations,
gene names, and keywords, along with the accession numbers of the records
in which they can be found (see Section 3.3). The line-lengths of
these files is variable.

2.2 Files

  This GenBank flat file release consists of 562 files. The lists
that follow describe each of the files included in the distribution.
Their sizes and base pair content are also summarized.

  The gbcon.seq data file provides an alternative representation for complex
sequences, such as segmented sets and complete-genomes that have been split
into pieces. These "CON" records do not contain sequence data; they utilize
a CONTIG linetype with a join() statement which describes how the component
sequences can be assembled to form the larger sequence. The contents of the 
CON division are not reflected in the 'index', 'new', 'chg', and 'del' files
that accompany GenBank releases, nor in release statistics (Sections 2.2.6,
2.2.7, and 2.2.8). The GenBank README describes the CON division of GenBank
in more detail:

2.2.5 File Sizes

  Uncompressed, the Release 138.0 flatfiles require roughly 118 GB (sequence
files only) or 131 GB (including the 'short directory' and 'index' files).
The following table contains the approximate sizes of the individual files in
this release.  Since minor changes to some of the files might have occurred
after these release notes were written, these sizes should not be used to
determine file integrity; they are provided as an aid to planning only.

3. FILE FORMATS

  The flat file examples included in this section, while not always from the
current release, are usually fairly recent.  Any differences compared to the
actual records are the result of updates to the entries involved.

3.1 File Header Information

  With the exception of the index files, gbcon.seq, and the lists of new,
changed, and deleted accession numbers, each of the 562 files of a GenBank
release begins with the same header, except for the first line, which
contains the file name, and the sixth line, which contains the title of
the file. The first line of the file contains the file name in character
positions 1 to 9 and the full database name (Genetic Sequence Data Bank,
aka 'GenBank') starting in column 22. The brief names of the files in this
release are listed in section 2.2.

  The second line contains the date of the current release in the form
`day month year', beginning in position 27. The fourth line contains
the current GenBank release number. The release number appears in
positions 48 to 52 and consists of three numbers separated by a decimal
point. The number to the left of the decimal is the major release
number. The digit to the right of the decimal indicates the version of
the major release; it is zero for the first version. The sixth line
contains a title for the file. The eighth line lists the number of
entries (loci), number of bases (or base pairs), and number of reports
of sequences (equal to number of entries in this case). These numbers are
right-justified at fixed positions. The number of entries appears in
positions 1 to 8, the number of bases in positions 16 to 26, and the
number of reports in positions 40 to 47. The third, fifth, seventh, and
ninth lines are blank.

3.2 Directory Files

3.2.1 Short Directory File

  The short directory file contains brief descriptions of all of the
sequence entries contained in this release. These descriptions are in
fifteen groups, one group for each of the fifteen sequence entry
data files. The first record at the beginning of a group of entries
contains the name of the group in uppercase characters, beginning in
position 21. The organism groups are PRIMATE, RODENT, OTHER MAMMAL,
OTHER VERTEBRATE, INVERTEBRATE, PLANT, BACTERIAL, STRUCTURAL RNA, VIRAL,
PHAGE, SYNTHETIC, UNANNOTATED, EXPRESSED SEQUENCE TAG, PATENT, or
SEQUENCE TAGGED SITE.  The second record is blank.

  Each record in the short directory contains the sequence entry name
(LOCUS) in the first 12 positions, followed by a brief definition of
the sequence beginning in column 13. The definition is truncated (at
the end of a word) to leave room at the right margin for at least one
space, the sequence length, and the letters `bp'. The length of the
sequence is printed right-justified to column 77, followed by the
letters `bp' in columns 78 and 79. The next-to-last record for a group
has `ZZZZZZZZZZ' in its first ten positions (where the entry name
would normally appear). The last record is a blank line. An example of
the short directory file format, showing the descriptions of the last
entries in the Other Vertebrate sequence data file and the first
entries of the Invertebrate sequence data file, is reproduced below:

3.3 Index Files

There are six files containing indices to the entries in this release:

  Accession number index file (Accession and Version)
  Secondary accession number index file
  Keyword phrase index file
  Author name index file
  Journal citation index file
  Gene name index file

  The index keys (accession numbers, keywords, authors, journals, and
gene symbols.) of an index are sorted alphabetically. All index keys
appear in uppercase characters even though they appear in mixed case
in the sequence entries. Following each index key, the identifiers of the
sequence entries containing that key are listed (LOCUS name,
division abbreviation, and primary accession number). The division
abbreviations are:

 1. PRI - primate sequences
 2. ROD - rodent sequences
 3. MAM - other mammalian sequences
 4. VRT - other vertebrate sequences
 5. INV - invertebrate sequences
 6. PLN - plant, fungal, and algal sequences
 7. BCT - bacterial sequences
 8. VRL - viral sequences
 9. PHG - bacteriophage sequences
10. SYN - synthetic sequences
11. UNA - unannotated sequences
12. EST - EST sequences (expressed sequence tags) 
13. PAT - patent sequences
14. STS - STS sequences (sequence tagged sites) 
15. GSS - GSS sequences (genome survey sequences) 
16. HTG - HTGS sequences (high throughput genomic sequences) 
17. HTC - HTC sequences (high throughput cDNA sequences) 

  A line-oriented, TAB-delimited format is utilized for the gbaut.idx,
gbgen.idx,  gbjou.idx, gbkey.idx, and gbsec.idx indexes. Each index
key is presented on its own line, and is followed by a
LOCUS/Division/Accession triplet for every record containing the key:

Indexed-Term 
        LOCUS-name1 Div-code1 Accession1 
        LOCUS-name2 Div-code2 Accession2 
        LOCUS-name3 Div-code3 Accession3 
        .... 

  Here is an example of the format, in which TAB characters are displayed 
as ^I, and carriage-returns/newlines as $ : 

(H+,K+)-ATPASE BETA-SUBUNIT$ 
^IRATHKATPB^IROD^IM55655$ 
^IMUSATP4B1^IROD^IM64685$ 
^IMUSATP4B2^IROD^IM64686$ 
^IMUSATP4B3^IROD^IM64687$ 
^IMUSATP4B4^IROD^IM64688$ 
^IDOGATPASEB^IMAM^IM76486$ 

When viewed by a file browser such as 'less' or 'more' : 

(H+,K+)-ATPASE BETA-SUBUNIT 
        RATHKATPB ROD M55655 
        MUSATP4B1 ROD M64685 
        MUSATP4B2 ROD M64686 
        MUSATP4B3 ROD M64687 
        MUSATP4B4 ROD M64688 
        DOGATPASEB MAM M76486 

  Note that the index keys can be distinguished from LOCUS/DIV/ACCESSION 
by the fact that they do not start with a TAB character. So one can 
extract just the terms via simple text-processing: 

        perl -ne 'print unless /^\s+/' < gbkey.idx > terms.gbkey

  The format of the primary accession number index file is slightly
different, with each indexed key (Accession.Version) present on
the same line as the LOCUS/Division/Accession triplet:

Accession1.Version1 Locus-name1 Div-code1 Accession1 
Accession2.Version2 Locus-name2 Div-code2 Accession2 
.... 

  Here is an example of the format, in which TAB characters are displayed 
as ^I, and carriage-returns/newlines as $ : 

AC000102.1^IAC000102^IPRI^IAC000102$ 
AC000103.1^IAC000103^IPLN^IAC000103$

3.3.1 Accession Number Index File - gbacc.idx

  Accession numbers are unique six character or eight-character alphanumeric
identifiers of GenBank database entries. The six-character accession
number format consists of a single uppercase letter, followed by 5 digits.
The eight-character accession number format consists of two uppercase
letters, followed by 6 digits.  Accessions provide an unchanging identifier
for the data with which they are associated, and we encourage you to cite
accession numbers whenever you refer to data from GenBank.

  GenBank entries can have both 'primary' and 'secondary' accessions
associated with them (see Section 3.5.6). Only primary accessions are present
in the gbacc.idx index.

3.3.2 Keyword Phrase Index File - gbkey.idx

  Keyword phrases consist of names for gene products and other
characteristics of sequence entries.

3.3.3 Author Name Index File - gbaut*.idx

The author name index files list all of the author names that appear
in the references within sequence records.

3.3.4 Journal Citation Index File - gbjou.idx

  The journal citation index file lists all of the citations that appear
in the references within sequence records.. All citations are truncated
to 80 characters.

3.3.5 Gene Name Index - gbgen.idx

  The /gene qualifiers of many GenBank entries contain values other than
official gene symbols, such as the product or the standard name of the gene.
Hence, NCBI has chosen to build an index (gbgen.idx) more like a keyword index
for this field, using both the GenBank /gene qualifier and the 'Gene.locus'
fields from the NCBI internal database as keys.

3.4 Sequence Entry Files

  GenBank releases contain one or more sequence entry data files, one
for each "division" of GenBank.

3.4.1 File Organization

  Each of these files has the same format and consists of two parts:
header information (described in section 3.1) and sequence entries for
that division (described in the following sections).

3.4.2  Entry Organization

  In the second portion of a sequence entry file (containing the
sequence entries for that division), each record (line) consists of
two parts. The first part is found in positions 1 to 10 and may
contain:

1. A keyword, beginning in column 1 of the record (e.g., REFERENCE is
a keyword).

2. A subkeyword beginning in column 3, with columns 1 and 2 blank
(e.g., AUTHORS is a subkeyword of REFERENCE). Or a subkeyword beginning
in column 4, with columns 1, 2, and 3 blank (e.g., PUBMED is a
subkeyword of REFERENCE).

3. Blank characters, indicating that this record is a continuation of
the information under the keyword or subkeyword above it.

4. A code, beginning in column 6, indicating the nature of an entry
(feature key) in the FEATURES table; these codes are described in
Section 3.4.12.1 below.

5. A number, ending in column 9 of the record. This number occurs in
the portion of the entry describing the actual nucleotide sequence and
designates the numbering of sequence positions.

6. Two slashes (//) in positions 1 and 2, marking the end of an entry.

  The second part of each sequence entry record contains the information
appropriate to its keyword, in positions 13 to 80 for keywords and
positions 11 to 80 for the sequence.

  The following is a brief description of each entry field. Detailed
information about each field may be found in Sections 3.4.4 to 3.4.14.

LOCUS	- A short mnemonic name for the entry, chosen to suggest the
sequence's definition. Mandatory keyword/exactly one record.

DEFINITION	- A concise description of the sequence. Mandatory
keyword/one or more records.

ACCESSION	- The primary accession number is a unique, unchanging
code assigned to each entry. (Please use this code when citing
information from GenBank.) Mandatory keyword/one or more records.

VERSION		- A compound identifier consisting of the primary
accession number and a numeric version number associated with the
current version of the sequence data in the record. This is followed
by an integer key (a "GI") assigned to the sequence by NCBI.
Mandatory keyword/exactly one record.

NID		- An alternative method of presenting the NCBI GI
identifier (described above). The NID is obsolete and was removed
from the GenBank flatfile format in December 1999.

KEYWORDS	- Short phrases describing gene products and other
information about an entry. Mandatory keyword in all annotated
entries/one or more records.

SEGMENT	- Information on the order in which this entry appears in a
series of discontinuous sequences from the same molecule. Optional
keyword (only in segmented entries)/exactly one record.

SOURCE	- Common name of the organism or the name most frequently used
in the literature. Mandatory keyword in all annotated entries/one or
more records/includes one subkeyword.

   ORGANISM	- Formal scientific name of the organism (first line)
and taxonomic classification levels (second and subsequent lines).
Mandatory subkeyword in all annotated entries/two or more records.

REFERENCE	- Citations for all articles containing data reported
in this entry. Includes seven subkeywords and may repeat. Mandatory
keyword/one or more records.

   AUTHORS	- Lists the authors of the citation. Optional
subkeyword/one or more records.

   CONSRTM	- Lists the collective names of consortiums associated
with the citation (eg, International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium),
rather than individual author names. Optional subkeyword/one or more records.

   TITLE	- Full title of citation. Optional subkeyword (present
in all but unpublished citations)/one or more records.

   JOURNAL	- Lists the journal name, volume, year, and page
numbers of the citation. Mandatory subkeyword/one or more records.

   MEDLINE	- Provides the Medline unique identifier for a
citation. Optional subkeyword/one record.

    PUBMED 	- Provides the PubMed unique identifier for a
citation. Optional subkeyword/one record.

   REMARK	- Specifies the relevance of a citation to an
entry. Optional subkeyword/one or more records.

COMMENT	- Cross-references to other sequence entries, comparisons to
other collections, notes of changes in LOCUS names, and other remarks.
Optional keyword/one or more records/may include blank records.

FEATURES	- Table containing information on portions of the
sequence that code for proteins and RNA molecules and information on
experimentally determined sites of biological significance. Optional
keyword/one or more records.

BASE COUNT	- Summary of the number of occurrences of each base
code in the sequence. Mandatory keyword/exactly one record.

ORIGIN	- Specification of how the first base of the reported sequence
is operationally located within the genome. Where possible, this
includes its location within a larger genetic map. Mandatory
keyword/exactly one record.

	- The ORIGIN line is followed by sequence data (multiple records).

// 	- Entry termination symbol. Mandatory at the end of an
entry/exactly one record.

3.4.3 Sample Sequence Data File

  An example of a complete sequence entry file follows. (This example
has only two entries.) Note that in this example, as throughout the
data bank, numbers in square brackets indicate items in the REFERENCE
list. For example, in ACARR58S, [1] refers to the paper by Mackay, et
al.

Example 9. Sample Sequence Data File


3.4.4 LOCUS Format

  The items of information contained in the LOCUS record are always
found in fixed positions. The locus name (or entry name), which is
always sixteen characters or less, begins in position 13. The locus name
is designed to help group entries with similar sequences: the first
three characters usually designate the organism; the fourth and fifth
characters can be used to show other group designations, such as gene
product; for segmented entries the last character is one of a series
of sequential integers.

  The number of bases or base pairs in the sequence ends in position 40.
The letters `bp' are in positions 42 to 43. Positions 45 to 47 provide
the number of strands of the sequence. Positions 48 to 53 indicate the
type of molecule sequenced. Topology of the molecule is indicated in
positions 56 to 63.

  GenBank sequence entries are divided among many different
'divisions'. Each entry's division is specified by a three-letter code
in positions 65 to 67. See Section 3.3 for an explanation of division
codes.

  Positions 69 to 79 of the record contain the date the entry was
entered or underwent any substantial revisions, such as the addition
of newly published data, in the form dd-MMM-yyyy.

The detailed format for the LOCUS line format is as follows:

Positions  Contents
---------  --------
01-05      'LOCUS'
06-12      spaces
13-28      Locus name
29-29      space
30-40      Length of sequence, right-justified
41-41      space
42-43      bp
44-44      space
45-47      spaces, ss- (single-stranded), ds- (double-stranded), or
           ms- (mixed-stranded)
48-53      NA, DNA, RNA, tRNA (transfer RNA), rRNA (ribosomal RNA), 
           mRNA (messenger RNA), uRNA (small nuclear RNA), snRNA,
           snoRNA. Left justified.
54-55      space
56-63      'linear' followed by two spaces, or 'circular'
64-64      space
65-67      The division code (see Section 3.3)
68-68      space
69-79      Date, in the form dd-MMM-yyyy (e.g., 15-MAR-1991)

  Although each of these data values can be found at column-specific
positions, we encourage those who parse the contents of the LOCUS
line to use a token-based approach. This will prevent the need for
software changes if the spacing of the data values ever has to be
modified.

3.4.5 DEFINITION Format

  The DEFINITION record gives a brief description of the sequence,
proceeding from general to specific. It starts with the common name of
the source organism, then gives the criteria by which this sequence is
distinguished from the remainder of the source genome, such as the
gene name and what it codes for, or the protein name and mRNA, or some
description of the sequence's function (if the sequence is
non-coding). If the sequence has a coding region, the description may
be followed by a completeness qualifier, such as cds (complete coding
sequence). There is no limit on the number of lines that may be part
of the DEFINITION.  The last line must end with a period.

3.4.5.1 DEFINITION Format for NLM Entries

  The DEFINITION line for entries derived from journal-scanning at the NLM is
an automatically generated descriptive summary that accompanies each DNA and
protein sequence. It contains information derived from fields in a database 
that summarize the most important attributes of the sequence.  The DEFINITION
lines are designed to supplement the accession number and the sequence itself
as a means of uniquely and completely specifying DNA and protein sequences. The
following are examples of NLM DEFINITION lines:

NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase [swine, mRNA, 1 gene, 1585 nt]

94 kda fiber cell beaded-filament structural protein [rats, lens, mRNA
Partial, 1 gene, 1873 nt]

inhibin alpha {promoter and exons} [mice, Genomic, 1 gene, 1102 nt, segment
1 of 2]

cefEF, cefG=acetyl coenzyme A:deacetylcephalosporin C o-acetyltransferase
[Acremonium chrysogenum, Genomic, 2 genes, 2639 nt]

myogenic factor 3, qmf3=helix-loop-helix protein [Japanese quails,
embryo, Peptide Partial, 246 aa]


  The first part of the definition line contains information describing
the genes and proteins represented by the molecular sequences.  This can
be gene locus names, protein names and descriptions that replace or augment
actual names.  Gene and gene product are linked by "=".  Any special
identifying terms are presented within brackets, such as: {promoter},
{N-terminal}, {EC 2.13.2.4}, {alternatively spliced}, or {3' region}.

  The second part of the definition line is delimited by square brackets, '[]',
and provides details about the molecule type and length.  The biological
source, i.e., genus and species or common name as cited by the author.
Developmental stage, tissue type and strain are included if available.
The molecule types include: Genomic, mRNA, Peptide. and Other Genomic
Material. Genomic molecules are assumed to be partial sequence unless
"Complete" is specified, whereas mRNA and peptide molecules are assumed
to be complete unless "Partial" is noted.

3.4.6 ACCESSION Format

  This field contains a series of six-character and/or eight-character
identifiers called 'accession numbers'. The six-character accession
number format consists of a single uppercase letter, followed by 5 digits.
The eight-character accession number format consists of two uppercase
letters, followed by 6 digits. The 'primary', or first, of the accession
numbers occupies positions 13 to 18 (6-character format) or positions
13 to 20 (8-character format). Subsequent 'secondary' accession numbers
(if present) are separated from the primary, and from each other, by a
single space. In some cases, multiple lines of secondary accession
numbers might be present, starting at position 13.

  The primary accession number of a GenBank entry provides a stable identifier
for the biological object that the entry represents. Accessions do not change
when the underlying sequence data or associated features change.

  Secondary accession numbers arise for a number of reasons. For example, a
single accession number may initially be assigned to a sequence described in
a publication. If it is later discovered that the sequence must be entered
into the database as multiple entries, each entry would receive a new primary
accession number, and the original accession number would appear as a secondary
accession number on each of the new entries.

3.4.7 VERSION Format

  This line contains two types of identifiers for a GenBank database entry:
a compound accession number and an NCBI GI identifier. 

LOCUS       AF181452     1294 bp    DNA             PLN       12-OCT-1999
DEFINITION  Hordeum vulgare dehydrin (Dhn2) gene, complete cds.
ACCESSION   AF181452
VERSION     AF181452.1  GI:6017929
            ^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^
            Compound    NCBI GI
            Accession   Identifier
            Number

  A compound accession number consists of two parts: a stable, unchanging
primary-accession number portion (see Section 3.4.6 for a description of
accession numbers), and a sequentially increasing numeric version number.
The accession and version numbers are separated by a period. The initial
version number assigned to a new sequence is one. Compound accessions are
often referred to as "Accession.Version" .

  An accession number allows one to retrieve the same biological object in the
database, regardless of any changes that are made to the entry over time. But
those changes can include changes to the sequence data itself, which is of
fundamental importance to many database users. So a numeric version number is
associated with the sequence data in every database entry. If an entry (for
example, AF181452) undergoes two sequence changes, its compound accession
number on the VERSION line would start as AF181452.1 . After the first sequence
change this would become: AF181452.2 . And after the second change: AF181452.3 .

  The NCBI GI identifier of the VERSION line also serves as a method for
identifying the sequence data that has existed for a database entry over
time. GI identifiers are numeric values of one or more digits. Since they
are integer keys, they are less human-friendly than the Accession.Version
system described above. Returning to our example for AF181452, it was
initially assigned GI 6017929. If the sequence changes, a new integer GI will
be assigned, perhaps 7345003 . And after the second sequence change, perhaps
the GI would become 10456892 .

  Why are both these methods for identifying the version of the sequence
associated with a database entry in use? For two reasons:

- Some data sources processed by NCBI for incorporation into its Entrez
  sequence retrieval system do not version their own sequences.

- GIs provide a uniform, integer identifier system for every sequence
  NCBI has processed. Some products and systems derived from (or reliant
  upon) NCBI products and services prefer to use these integer identifiers
  because they can all be processed in the same manner.

GenBank Releases contain only the most recent versions of all sequences
in the database. However, older versions can be obtained via GI-based or
Accession.Version-based queries with NCBI's web-Entrez and network-Entrez
applications. A sequence revision history web page is also available:

	  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Entrez/girevhist

NOTE: All the version numbers for the compound Accession.Version identifier
system were initialized to a value of one in February 1999, when that
system was introduced.

3.4.8 KEYWORDS Format

  The KEYWORDS field does not appear in unannotated entries, but is
required in all annotated entries. Keywords are separated by
semicolons; a "keyword" may be a single word or a phrase consisting of
several words. Each line in the keywords field ends in a semicolon;
the last line ends with a period. If no keywords are included in the
entry, the KEYWORDS record contains only a period.

3.4.9 SEGMENT Format

  The SEGMENT keyword is used when two (or more) entries of known
relative orientation are separated by a short (<10 kb) stretch of DNA.
It is limited to one line of the form `n of m', where `n' is the
segment number of the current entry and `m' is the total number of
segments.

3.4.10 SOURCE Format

  The SOURCE field consists of two parts. The first part is found after
the SOURCE keyword and contains free-format information including an
abbreviated form of the organism name followed by a molecule type;
multiple lines are allowed, but the last line must end with a period.
The second part consists of information found after the ORGANISM
subkeyword. The formal scientific name for the source organism (genus
and species, where appropriate) is found on the same line as ORGANISM.
The records following the ORGANISM line list the taxonomic
classification levels, separated by semicolons and ending with a
period.

3.4.11 REFERENCE Format

  The REFERENCE field consists of five parts: the keyword REFERENCE, and
the subkeywords AUTHORS, TITLE (optional), JOURNAL, MEDLINE (optional),
PUBMED (optional), and REMARK (optional).

  The REFERENCE line contains the number of the particular reference and
(in parentheses) the range of bases in the sequence entry reported in
this citation. Additional prose notes may also be found within the
parentheses. The numbering of the references does not reflect
publication dates or priorities.

  The AUTHORS line lists the authors in the order in which they appear
in the cited article. Last names are separated from initials by a
comma (no space); there is no comma before the final `and'. The list
of authors ends with a period.  The TITLE line is an optional field,
although it appears in the majority of entries. It does not appear in
unpublished sequence data entries that have been deposited directly
into the GenBank data bank, the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Library,
or the DNA Data Bank of Japan. The TITLE field does not end with a
period.

  The JOURNAL line gives the appropriate literature citation for the
sequence in the entry. The word `Unpublished' will appear after the
JOURNAL subkeyword if the data did not appear in the scientific
literature, but was directly deposited into the data bank. For
published sequences the JOURNAL line gives the Thesis, Journal, or
Book citation, including the year of publication, the specific
citation, or In press.

  For Book citations, the JOURNAL line is specially-formatted, and
includes:

	editor name(s)
	book title
	page number(s)
	publisher-name/publisher-location
	year

For example:

  The presence of "(in)" signals the fact that the reference is for a book
rather than a journal article. A semi-colon signals the end of the editor
names. The next semi-colon signals the end of the page numbers, and the
colon that immediately *precedes* the page numbers signals the end of the
book title. The publisher name and location are a free-form text string.
Finally, the year appears at the very end of the JOURNAL line, enclosed in
parentheses.

  The MEDLINE line provides the National Library of Medicine's Medline
unique identifier for a citation (if known). Medline UIs are 8 digit
numbers.

  The PUBMED line provides the PubMed unique identifier for a citation
(if known). PUBMED ids are numeric, and are record identifiers for article
abstracts in the PubMed database :

       http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed

  Citations in PubMed that do not fall within Medline's scope will have only
a PUBMED identifier. Similarly, citations that *are* in Medline's scope but
which have not yet been assigned Medline UIs will have only a PUBMED identifier.
If a citation is present in both the PubMed and Medline databases, both a
MEDLINE and a PUBMED line will be present.

  The REMARK line is a textual comment that specifies the relevance
of the citation to the entry.

3.4.12 FEATURES Format

  GenBank releases use a feature table format designed jointly by
GenBank, the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Library, and the DNA Data
Bank of Japan. This format is in use by all three databases. The
most complete and accurate Feature Table documentation can be found
on the Web at:

	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/collab/FT/index.html

  Any discrepancy between the abbreviated feature table description
of these release notes and the complete documentation on the Web
should be resolved in favor of the version at the above URL.

  The Feature Table specification is also available as a printed
document: `The DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank Feature Table: Definition'. Contact
GenBank at the address shown on the first page of these Release Notes
if you would like a copy.

  The feature table contains information about genes and gene products,
as well as regions of biological significance reported in the
sequence. The feature table contains information on regions of the
sequence that code for proteins and RNA molecules. It also enumerates
differences between different reports of the same sequence, and
provides cross-references to other data collections, as described in
more detail below.

  The first line of the feature table is a header that includes the
keyword `FEATURES' and the column header `Location/Qualifier.' Each
feature consists of a descriptor line containing a feature key and a
location (see sections below for details). If the location does not
fit on this line, a continuation line may follow. If further
information about the feature is required, one or more lines
containing feature qualifiers may follow the descriptor line.

  The feature key begins in column 6 and may be no more than 15
characters in length. The location begins in column 22. Feature
qualifiers begin on subsequent lines at column 22. Location,
qualifier, and continuation lines may extend from column 22 to 80.

  Feature tables are required, due to the mandatory presence of the
source feature. The sections below provide a brief introduction to
the feature table format.

3.4.12.1 Feature Key Names

  The first column of the feature descriptor line contains the feature
key. It starts at column 6 and can continue to column 20. The list of
valid feature keys is shown below.

3.4.12.2 Feature Location

  The second column of the feature descriptor line designates the
location of the feature in the sequence. The location descriptor
begins at position 22. Several conventions are used to indicate
sequence location.

  Base numbers in location descriptors refer to numbering in the entry,
which is not necessarily the same as the numbering scheme used in the
published report. The first base in the presented sequence is numbered
base 1. Sequences are presented in the 5 to 3 direction.

Location descriptors can be one of the following:

1. A single base;

2. A contiguous span of bases;

3. A site between two bases;

4. A single base chosen from a range of bases;

5. A single base chosen from among two or more specified bases;

6. A joining of sequence spans;

7. A reference to an entry other than the one to which the feature
belongs (i.e., a remote entry), followed by a location descriptor
referring to the remote sequence;

  A site between two residues, such as an endonuclease cleavage site, is
indicated by listing the two bases separated by a carat (e.g., 23^24).

  A single residue chosen from a range of residues is indicated by the
number of the first and last bases in the range separated by a single
period (e.g., 23.79). The symbols < and > indicate that the end point
of the range is beyond the specified base number.

  A contiguous span of bases is indicated by the number of the first and
last bases in the range separated by two periods (e.g., 23..79). The
symbols < and > indicate that the end point of the range is beyond the
specified base number. Starting and ending positions can be indicated
by base number or by one of the operators described below.

  Operators are prefixes that specify what must be done to the indicated
sequence to locate the feature. The following are the operators
available, along with their most common format and a description.

complement (location): The feature is complementary to the location
indicated. Complementary strands are read 5 to 3.

join (location, location, .. location): The indicated elements should
be placed end to end to form one contiguous sequence.

order (location, location, .. location): The elements are found in the
specified order in the 5 to 3 direction, but nothing is implied about
the rationality of joining them.

3.4.12.3  Feature Qualifiers

  Qualifiers provide additional information about features. They take
the form of a slash (/) followed by a qualifier name and, if
applicable, an equal sign (=) and a qualifier value. Feature
qualifiers begin at column 22.

Qualifiers convey many types of information. Their values can,
therefore, take several forms:

1. Free text;
2. Controlled vocabulary or enumerated values;
3. Citations or reference numbers;
4. Sequences;
5. Feature labels.

  Text qualifier values must be enclosed in double quotation marks. The
text can consist of any printable characters (ASCII values 32-126
decimal). If the text string includes double quotation marks, each set
must be `escaped' by placing a double quotation mark in front of it
(e.g., /note="This is an example of ""escaped"" quotation marks").

  Some qualifiers require values selected from a limited set of choices.
For example, the `/direction' qualifier has only three values `left,'
`right,' or `both.' These are called controlled vocabulary qualifier
values. Controlled qualifier values are not case sensitive; they can
be entered in any combination of upper- and lowercase without changing
their meaning.

  Citation or published reference numbers for the entry should be
enclosed in square brackets ([]) to distinguish them from other
numbers.

  A literal sequence of bases (e.g., "atgcatt") should be enclosed in
quotation marks. Literal sequences are distinguished from free text by
context. Qualifiers that take free text as their values do not take
literal sequences, and vice versa.

  The `/label=' qualifier takes a feature label as its qualifier.
Although feature labels are optional, they allow unambiguous
references to the feature. The feature label identifies a feature
within an entry; when combined with the accession number and the name
of the data bank from which it came, it is a unique tag for that
feature. Feature labels must be unique within an entry, but can be the
same as a feature label in another entry. Feature labels are not case
sensitive; they can be entered in any combination of upper-and
lowercase without changing their meaning.

The following is a partial list of feature qualifiers.

/anticodon	Location of the anticodon of tRNA and the amino acid
		for which it codes

/bound_moiety	Moiety bound

3.4.12.4 Cross-Reference Information

  One type of information in the feature table lists cross-references to
the annual compilation of transfer RNA sequences in Nucleic Acids
Research, which has kindly been sent to us on CD-ROM by Dr. Sprinzl.
Each tRNA entry of the feature table contains a /note= qualifier that
includes a reference such as `(NAR: 1234)' to identify code 1234 in
the NAR compilation. When such a cross-reference appears in an entry
that contains a gene coding for a transfer RNA molecule, it refers to
the code in the tRNA gene compilation. Similar cross-references in
entries containing mature transfer RNA sequences refer to the
companion compilation of tRNA sequences published by D.H. Gauss and M.
Sprinzl in Nucleic Acids Research.

3.4.12.5 Feature Table Examples

  In the first example a number of key names, feature locations, and
qualifiers are illustrated, taken from different sequences. The first
table entry is a coding region consisting of a simple span of bases
and including a /gene qualifier. In the second table entry, an NAR
cross-reference is given (see the previous section for a discussion of
these cross-references). The third and fourth table entries use the
symbols `<`and `>' to indicate that the beginning or end of the
feature is beyond the range of the presented sequence. In the fifth
table entry, the symbol `^' indicates that the feature is between
bases.

Example 11. Joining Sequences


3.4.13 ORIGIN Format

  The ORIGIN record may be left blank, may appear as `Unreported.' or
may give a local pointer to the sequence start, usually involving an
experimentally determined restriction cleavage site or the genetic
locus (if available). The ORIGIN record ends in a period if it
contains data, but does not include the period if the record is left
empty (in contrast to the KEYWORDS field which contains a period
rather than being left blank).

3.4.14 SEQUENCE Format

  The nucleotide sequence for an entry is found in the records following
the ORIGIN record. The sequence is reported in the 5 to 3 direction.
There are sixty bases per record, listed in groups of ten bases
followed by a blank, starting at position 11 of each record. The
number of the first nucleotide in the record is given in columns 4 to
9 (right justified) of the record.


4. ALTERNATE RELEASES

  NCBI is supplying sequence data in the GenBank flat file format to
maintain compatibility with existing software which require that
particular format.  Although we have made every effort to ensure
that these data are presented in the traditional flat file format,
if you encounter any problems in using these data with software which
is based upon the flat file format, please contact us at:

              info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

  The flat file is just one of many possible report formats that can be
generated from the richer representation supported by the ASN.1 form of the
data.  Developers of new software tools should consider using the ASN.1 form
directly to take advantage of those features.  Documentation and a Software
Developer's Toolkit for ASN.1 are available through NCBI.  You may call NCBI
at (301)496-2475, or subscribe to a developers' electronic newsgroup by
sending your name, address, affiliation, and e-mail address to:

              bits-request@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

  The Software Developer's Toolkit and PostScript documentation for UNIX,
VMS, Ultrix, AIX, MacOS, DOS, and Microsoft Windows systems is available
in a compressed UNIX tar file by anonymous ftp from 'ftp.ncbi.nih.gov',
in the toolbox/ncbi_tools directory. The file is 'ncbi.tar.Z'.


5. KNOWN PROBLEMS OF THE GENBANK DATABASE

5.1 Incorrect Gene Symbols in Entries and Index

  The /gene qualifier for many GenBank entries contains values other than the
official gene symbol, such as the product or the standard name of the gene. The
gene symbol index (gbgen.idx) is created from the data in the /gene qualifier
and therefore may contain data other than official gene symbols.


6. GENBANK ADMINISTRATION 

  The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), National Library
of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, is responsible for the production
and distribution of the NIH GenBank Sequence Database.  NCBI distributes
GenBank sequence data by anonymous FTP, e-mail servers and other
network services.  For more information, you may contact NCBI at the
e-mail address:  info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov  or by phone: 301-496-2475.

6.1 Registered Trademark Notice

  GenBank (R) is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services for the Genetic Sequence Data Bank.

6.2 Citing GenBank

  If you have used GenBank in your research, we would appreciate it if
you would include a reference to GenBank in all publications related
to that research.

  When citing data in GenBank, it is appropriate to give the sequence
name, primary accession number, and the publication in which the
sequence first appeared.  If the data are unpublished, we urge you to
contact the group which submitted the data to GenBank to see if there
is a recent publication or if they have determined any revisions or
extensions of the data.

  It is also appropriate to list a reference for GenBank itself.  The
following publication, which describes the GenBank database, should
be cited:

    Benson D.A., Karsch-Mizrachi I., Lipman D.J., Ostell J., Rapp B.A., 
    Wheeler D.L.  GenBank. Nucl. Acids Res. 28(1):15-18 (2000)

  The following statement is an example of how you may cite GenBank
data.  It cites the sequence, its primary accession number, the group
who determined the sequence, and GenBank.  The numbers in parentheses
refer to the GenBank citation above and to the REFERENCE in the
GenBank sequence entry.

`We scanned the GenBank (1) database for sequence similarities and
found one sequence (2), GenBank accession number J01016, which showed
significant similarity...'

  (1) Benson, D.A. et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 28(1):15-18 (2000)
  (2) Nellen, W. and Gallwitz, D. J. Mol. Biol. 159, 1-18 (1982)

6.3 GenBank Distribution Formats and Media

  Complete flat file releases of the GenBank database are available via
NCBI's anonymous ftp server:

	ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov

  Each release is cumulative, incorporating all previous GenBank data.
No retrieval software is provided. GenBank distribution via CD-ROM
ceased as of GenBank Release 106.0 (April, 1998).

  Mirrors of the GenBank FTP site at the NCBI are available from the
San Diego Supercomputer Center and the University of Indiana:

	ftp://genbank.sdsc.edu/pub
	ftp://bio-mirror.net/biomirror/genbank/

6.4 Other Methods of Accessing GenBank Data

  Entrez is a molecular biology database system that presents an integrated
view of DNA and protein sequence data, 3D structure data, complete genomes,
and associated MEDLINE entries. The system is produced by the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and is available only via
the Internet (using the Web-Entrez and Network-Entrez applications).

  Accessing Entrez is easy: if you have a World Wide Web browser, such as
Netscape or Internet-Explorer, simply point your browser to:

	 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/

  The Web version of Entrez has all the capabilities of the network version,
but with the visual style of the World Wide Web. If you prefer the "look and
feel" of Network-Entrez, you may download Network-Entrez from the NCBI's
FTP server:

	ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/

Versions are available for PC/Windows, Macintosh and several Unix variants.

  For information about Network-Entrez, Web-Entrez or any other NCBI
services, you may contact NCBI by e-mail at info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov or by
phone at 301-496-2475.

6.5 Request for Corrections and Comments

  We welcome your suggestions for improvements to GenBank. We are
especially interested to learn of errors or inconsistencies in the
data.  BankIt or Sequin can be used to submit revisions to previous
submissions.  In addition, suggestions and corrections can be sent by
electronic mail to:  update@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.  Please be certain to
indicate the GenBank release number (e.g., Release 138.0) and the
primary accession number of the entry to which your comments apply; it
is helpful if you also give the entry name and the current contents of
any data field for which you are recommending a change.
