*****************************************************************************

  Release 95.0 is a release of sequence data by NCBI in the GenBank flat file
format.  It contains a large number of entries produced at the NLM, derived
from scanning the biomedical literature. 

  GenBank contains sequences submitted directly to the database by authors
as well as entries created at NLM derived from scanning the biomedical
literature. Over 325,000 articles per year from 3400 journals are scanned
for sequence data. They are supplemented by journals in plant and veterinary
sciences through a collaboration with the National Agricultural Library.
GenBank is a component of a tri-partite, international collaboration of
sequence databases in the U.S., Europe, and Japan.  The collaborating
databases in Europe are the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)
at Hinxton Hall, UK, and the DNA Database of Japan (DDBJ) in Mishima, Japan.
Sequence data is also incorporated from the Genome Sequence Data Base (GSDB),
Santa Fe, NM.  Patent sequences are incorporated through arrangements with
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and via the collaborating international
databases from other international patent offices.  The database is converted
to various output formats, including the Flat File and Abstract Syntax
Notation 1 (ASN.1) versions.  The ASN.1 form of the data is included on
the Entrez: Sequences CD-ROM and is also available, as is the flat file,
by anonymous FTP to 'ncbi.nlm.nih.gov'.

1.2 Cutoff Date

  This full release, 95.0, incorporates data available to the databases as
of June 7, 1996.  For more recent data, users are advised to download
the update files by anonymous FTP to 'ncbi.nlm.nih.gov' or to search the
updates via the e-mail server.  For instructions, send a mail message with the
word 'help' in it to:  retrieve@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

1.3 Important Changes in Release 95.0

  Due to the growth in the number of EST sequences, the EST division is now
being split into seven pieces.

1.4 Upcoming Changes

1.4.1 New accession number format

  NOTE: It is very likely that accessions in the new 2+6 format described
below will appear starting with Release 96.0, and in the post-95.0
GenBank Update files!

  Currently, accession numbers used by the nucleotide sequence databases 
consist of one prefix letter followed by 5 digits.  EST projects and 
projects to add patent data have accelerated the need to extend the 
accession number space.  It is projected that the databases will run out
of accession numbers within 8 to 10 months.

* A new form of accession number will be created, defined as an
  8-character alphanumeric string, beginning with two upper case
  letters and followed only by digits (e.g., SR004562).  Leading and
  trailing zeros are significant.  The letter 'O' will not be used.

* Existing 6-character accession numbers will remain as they are, and will 
  never be transformed to an 8-character form.
 
* New accession numbers will not be used before February 1, 1996.
  DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank agree to avoid using new accession numbers as long
  as possible after that.

1.4.2 New GenBank Division in Release 96.0

  A new division, GSS (Genome Survey Sequence), will be added to the GenBank
Flatfile release distribution, starting with Release 96.0.

  This new division will be similar in nature to the EST division, except
that its sequences will be genomic in origin, rather than cDNA (mRNA).
The GSS division will contain (but will not be limited to) the following types
of data:

  - random "single pass read" genome survey sequences.
  - single pass reads from cosmid/BAC/YAC ends
    (these could be chromosome specific, but need not be)
  - exon trapped genomic sequences
  - Alu PCR sequences

  Many labs have approached GenBank over the last few months, interested
in submitting these types of sequences.  We have been reluctant to introduce
them via the existing GenBank divisions.  On the other hand, such sequences
are of value to the genome community, and require similar processing and
access tools as have been provided for EST's and STS's. GSS sequences will
will be used, amongst other things, as a framework for the mapping and
sequencing of genome size pieces which will be present in the standard GenBank
divisions.

  Sequence data appropriate for the new GSS division are, to date, generated
by genome labs performing human genome sequencing; we expect that similar
data will be generated for other model organisms, such as the mouse.

1.4.3 New GenBank Division in Release 97.0
 
  A new division, HTG (High Throughput Genome sequencing) will be added
to the GenBank Flatfile release distribution, starting with Release 97.0,
October 15, 1996.

  This new division will be used for genomic sequences which are now
produced by high-throughput sequencing projects.  The records are
expected to be primarily human and to include long sequences (subject
to the 350 kilobase limit for records in the International Sequence
Database Collaboration).  The annotation for many of these records is
expected to be generated through computer analyses.

1.4.4 Change to KEYWORDS format

  The format for the KEYWORDS field of the GenBank flatfile requires
that wrapped keyword values result in a new-line. For very long keywords,
this leads to:

KEYWORDS    bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase
            (DHFR-TS); 
            junction peptide domain; thymidylate synthase (TS) domain; 
            sis oncogene.

  Starting with GenBank Release 97.0, the requirement of a new-line for
wrapped keywords will be removed. For the example above, this would 
result in:

KEYWORDS    bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase
            (DHFR-TS); junction peptide domain; thymidylate synthase (TS)
            domain; sis oncogene.

1.5 Request for Direct Submission of Sequence Data

  A successful GenBank requires that the data enter the database as soon
as possible after publication, that the annotations be as complete as
possible, and that the sequence and annotation data be accurate. All
three of these requirements are best met if authors of sequence data
submit their data directly to GenBank in a usable form. It is especially
important that these submissions be in computer-readable form.

  GenBank must rely on direct author submission of data to ensure that
it achieves its goals of completeness, accuracy, and timeliness. To
assist researchers in entering their own sequence data, GenBank has
developed AUTHORIN, an easy-to-use program that enables authors to
enter a sequence, annotate it, and submit it to GenBank or any of the
other data banks.  NCBI distributes versions of authorin for IBM
PC-compatibles and the Macintosh. Contact NCBI by phone at 301-496-2475
or by electronic mail:  authorin@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

  GenBank users may now also use the World Wide Web (WWW) for submitting
sequences to GenBank.  A new submission tool - BankIt - provides a simple
forms approach for submitting your sequence and descriptive information to
GenBank.  Your submission will be submitted directly to GenBank and
immediately forwarded for inclusion in the EMBL and DDBJ databases.

  BankIt may be used with Netscape clients for Unix, Macs, and PCs, the
Mosaic client for Unix, and the MacWeb client for Macs. You can access BankIt
from GenBank's home page:

	          http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/

   If you have any questions on using BankIt, please contact the GenBank
support staff at 'info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov' or at (301) 496-2475.

  For those who are unable to use either AUTHORIN or BankIt, GenBank has a
printed data submission form. This form is standardized among
EMBL, DDBJ, GenBank, PIR, MIPS, and JIPID. GenBank also provides a
corresponding computer-readable data submission form that can be used
for electronic mail and floppy disk submissions. The GenBank Data
Submission Form (located in the file GBDAT.FRM) can be used to submit
your sequence and annotations. Electronic mail submissions should go
to: gb-sub@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.  Direct mail should go to:

3. FILE FORMATS

  The flat file examples included in this section, while not always from the
current release, are usually quite recent.  Any differences compared to the
actual data files are the result of updates to the entries involved.

3.1 File Header Information

  Each of the twenty-nine files on the distribution CD-ROM begins with the
same header, except for the first line, which contains the file name,
and the sixth line, which contains the title of the file. The first
line of the file contains the file name in character positions 1 to 9
and the full data bank name (Genetic Sequence Data Bank) starting in
column 20. The brief names of the files in this release are listed in
section 2.2.

  The second line contains the date of the current release in the form
`day month year', beginning in position 26. The fourth line contains
the current GenBank release number. The release number appears in
positions 41 to 45 and consists of two numbers separated by a decimal
point. The number to the left of the decimal is the major release
number. The digit to the right of the decimal indicates the version of
the major release; it is zero for the first version. The sixth line
contains a title for the file. The eighth line lists the number of
entries (loci), number of bases (or base pairs), and number of reports
of sequences (equal to number of entries in this case). These numbers are
right-justified at fixed positions. The number of entries appears in
positions 1 to 7, the number of bases in positions 15 to 23, and the
number of reports in positions 37 to 40. (There are more reports of
sequences than entries since reported sequences that overlap or
duplicate each other are combined into single entries.) The third,
fifth, seventh, and ninth lines are blank.

3.2 Directory Files

3.2.1 Short Directory File

  The short directory file contains brief descriptions of all of the
sequence entries contained in this release. These descriptions are in
fifteen groups, one group for each of the fifteen sequence entry
data files. The first record at the beginning of a group of entries
contains the name of the group in uppercase characters, beginning in
position 21. The organism groups are PRIMATE, RODENT, OTHER MAMMAL,
OTHER VERTEBRATE, INVERTEBRATE, PLANT, BACTERIAL, STRUCTURAL RNA, VIRAL,
PHAGE, SYNTHETIC, UNANNOTATED, EXPRESSED SEQUENCE TAG, PATENT, or
SEQUENCE TAGGED SITE.  The second record is blank.

  Each record in the short directory contains the sequence entry name
(LOCUS) in the first 12 positions, followed by a brief definition of
the sequence beginning in column 13. The definition is truncated (at
the end of a word) to leave room at the right margin for at least one
space, the sequence length, and the letters `bp'. The length of the
sequence is printed right-justified to column 77, followed by the
letters `bp' in columns 78 and 79. The next-to-last record for a group
has `ZZZZZZZZZZ' in its first ten positions (where the entry name
would normally appear). The last record is a blank line. An example of
the short directory file format, showing the descriptions of the last
entries in the Other Vertebrate sequence data file and the first
entries of the Invertebrate sequence data file, is reproduced below:

3.3 Index Files

There are five files containing indices to the entries in this release:

 Accession number index file
 Keyword phrase index file
 Author name index file
 Journal citation index file
 Gene name index file

  The index keys (accession numbers, keywords, authors, journals, and
gene symbols.) of an index are sorted alphabetically. (The index keys
for the keyword phrases and author names appear in uppercase
characters even though they appear in mixed case in the sequence
entries.) Under each index key, the names of the sequence entries
containing that index key are listed alphabetically. Each sequence
name is also followed by its data file division and primary accession
number. The following codes are used to designate the data file
divisions:

 1. PRI - primate sequences
 2. ROD - rodent sequences
 3. MAM - other mammalian sequences
 4. VRT - other vertebrate sequences
 5. INV - invertebrate sequences
 6. PLN - plant, fungal, and algal sequences
 7. BCT - bacterial sequences
 8. RNA - structural RNA sequences
 9. VRL - viral sequences
10. PHG - bacteriophage sequences
11. SYN - synthetic sequences
12. UNA - unannotated sequences
13. EST - EST sequences
14. PAT - patent sequences
15. STS - STS sequences

  The index key begins in column 1 of a record. An 11-character field
for the sequence entry name starts in position 14 of a record,
followed by a 3-character field for the data file division, starting
at position 25 and ending at position 27, and a 6-character field for
the primary accession number, starting at position 29 and ending at
position 34. All entries in the fields are left-justified.

  Beginning at positions 36 and 58, the three fields repeat, so three
sets of sequence information can appear in one record. If there are
more than three entry names, the next records are used; the index key
is not repeated. For the accession number files, the entry names begin
in the same record as the index key, since the key is always less than
12 characters. In the other index files, the entry names begin on the
record following the index key record.

3.3.1 Accession Number Index File

  Accession numbers consist of a single letter followed by five digits.
They provide an unchanging designation for the data with which they
are associated, and we encourage you to cite accession numbers
whenever you refer to data from the data bank. The primary accession
number is the first accession number of an entry. It is unique to that
entry. Citation of that number will enable other investigators to
locate the data no matter what entry name changes or other data bank
reorganizations may occur. The accession numbers, however, carry no
intrinsic information about the data.

  In addition to the primary accession number, some entries have
secondary accession numbers. Secondary accession numbers arise for a
number of reasons. For example, a single accession number may
initially be assigned to the sequence in an article. If it is later
discovered that the sequence must be entered into the data bank as
multiple entries, each entry would receive a new primary accession
number; the previous accession number would appear as the secondary
accession number in each entry.

  The following excerpt from the accession number index file illustrates
the format of the index:

1       10        20        30        40        50        60        70       79

Example 4. Accession Number Index File

  If the same accession number is found in more than one entry (a result
of the infrequent occasions when a single entry is split into two or
more separate entries), then the additional entries and groups in
which the number appears are also given.

3.3.2 Keyword Phrase Index File

  Keyword phrases consist of names for gene products and other
characteristics of sequence entries. There are approximately 18,000
keyword phrases. An excerpt from the keyword phrase index file is
shown below:

3.3.5 Gene Name Index

  The /gene qualifiers of many GenBank entries contain values other than
official gene symbols, such as the product or the standard name of the gene.
Hence, NCBI has chosen to build an index (gbgen.idx) more like a keyword index
for this field, using both the GenBank /gene qualifier and the 'Gene.locus'
fields from the NCBI internal database as keys. An excerpt from the gene name
index file is shown below:

1       10        20        30        40        50        60        70       79

3.4 GenBank Data Submission Form and Error/Suggestion Report Form

  The recommended method for submitting sequence data to GenBank is through
the Authorin program.  Copies for the Macintosh or PC are available free of
charge. For further information, contact NCBI at (301) 496-2475 or at
the following e-mail address:

           authorin@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

By using Authorin you will be assisting the database in making your
data available as quickly and as efficiently as possible.  

  If it is not possible to use Authorin, there is a data submission
form in this distribution (GBDAT.FRM) which can be filled out with
a text editor and returned to the database, preferably by e-mail.

  Direct submission e-mail address:  gb-sub@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

  The second form in the GBDAT.FRM is the GenBank Error/Suggestion Report
Form. It is separated from the Data Submission Form by a form-feed
character (<CTRL>L, ASCII octal value 014, ASCII decimal value 12). We
encourage all users to report any errors to the data bank staff
using this form. Like the GenBank Data Submission Form, it may be
printed and filled in by hand and sent by mail to the address given
at the beginning of the form. It may also be filled out using a text
editor and sent to GenBank by electronic mail at:  update@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov


3.5 Sequence Entry Files

  The distribution CD-ROM contains fifteen sequence entry data files, one
for each division of GenBank.

3.5.1 File Organization

  Each of these files has the same format and consists of two parts:
header information (described in section 3.1) and sequence entries for
that division (described in the following sections).

3.5.2  Entry Organization

  In the second portion of a sequence entry file (containing the
sequence entries for that division), each record (line) consists of
two parts. The first part is found in positions 1 to 10 and may
contain:

1. A keyword, beginning in column 1 of the record (e.g., REFERENCE is
a keyword).

2. A subkeyword beginning in column 3, with columns 1 and 2 blank
(e.g., AUTHORS is a subkeyword of REFERENCE).

3. Blank characters, indicating that this record is a continuation of
the information under the keyword or subkeyword above it.

4. A code, beginning in column 5, indicating the nature of an entry
(feature key) in the FEATURES table; these codes are described in
Section 3.5.12.1 below.

5. A number, ending in column 9 of the record. This number occurs in
the portion of the entry describing the actual nucleotide sequence and
designates the numbering of sequence positions.

6. Two slashes (//) in positions 1 and 2, marking the end of an entry.

  The second part of each sequence entry record contains the information
appropriate to its keyword, in positions 13 to 80 for keywords and
positions 11 to 80 for the sequence.

  The following is a brief description of each entry field. Detailed
information about each field may be found in Sections 3.5.4 to 3.5.14.

LOCUS	- A short mnemonic name for the entry, chosen to suggest the
sequence's definition. Mandatory keyword/exactly one record.

DEFINITION	- A concise description of the sequence. Mandatory
keyword/one or more records.

ACCESSION	- The primary accession number is a unique, unchanging
code assigned to each entry. (Please use this code when citing
information from GenBank.) Mandatory keyword/one or more records.

NID	- The unique nucleic acid identifier that has been assigned to
the current version of the sequence data that are associated with
the GenBank entry identified by a given primary accession number.

KEYWORDS	- Short phrases describing gene products and other
information about an entry. Mandatory keyword in all annotated
entries/one or more records.

SEGMENT	- Information on the order in which this entry appears in a
series of discontinuous sequences from the same molecule. Optional
keyword (only in segmented entries)/exactly one record.

SOURCE	- Common name of the organism or the name most frequently used
in the literature. Mandatory keyword in all annotated entries/one or
more records/includes one subkeyword.

   ORGANISM	- Formal scientific name of the organism (first line)
and taxonomic classification levels (second and subsequent lines).
Mandatory subkeyword in all annotated entries/two or more records.

REFERENCE	- Citations for all articles containing data reported
in this entry. Includes four subkeywords and may repeat. Mandatory
keyword/one or more records.

   AUTHORS	- Lists the authors of the citation. Mandatory
subkeyword/one or more records.

   TITLE	- Full title of citation. Optional subkeyword (present
in all but unpublished citations)/one or more records.

   JOURNAL	- Lists the journal name, volume, year, and page
numbers of the citation. Mandatory subkeyword/one or more records.

   MEDLINE	- Provides the Medline unique identifier for a
citation. Optional subkeyword/one record.

   REMARK	- Specifies the relevance of a citation to an
entry. Optional subkeyword/one or more records.

COMMENT	- Cross-references to other sequence entries, comparisons to
other collections, notes of changes in LOCUS names, and other remarks.
Optional keyword/one or more records/may include blank records.

FEATURES	- Table containing information on portions of the
sequence that code for proteins and RNA molecules and information on
experimentally determined sites of biological significance. Optional
keyword/one or more records.

BASE COUNT	- Summary of the number of occurrences of each base
code in the sequence. Mandatory keyword/exactly one record.

ORIGIN	- Specification of how the first base of the reported sequence
is operationally located within the genome. Where possible, this
includes its location within a larger genetic map. Mandatory
keyword/exactly one record.

	- The ORIGIN line is followed by sequence data (multiple records).

// 	- Entry termination symbol. Mandatory at the end of an
entry/exactly one record.

3.5.3 Sample Sequence Data File

  An example of a complete sequence entry file follows. (This example
has only two entries.) Note that in this example, as throughout the
data bank, numbers in square brackets indicate items in the REFERENCE
list. For example, in ACARR58S, [1] refers to the paper by Mackay, et
al.

Example 9. Sample Sequence Data File


3.5.4 LOCUS Format

  The pieces of information contained in the LOCUS record are always
found in fixed positions. The locus name (or entry name), which is
always ten characters or less, begins in position 13. The locus name
is designed to help group entries with similar sequences: the first
three characters usually designate the organism; the fourth and fifth
characters can be used to show other group designations, such as gene
product; for segmented entries the last character is one of a series
of sequential integers.

  The number of bases or base pairs in the sequence ends in position 29.
The letters `bp' are in positions 31 to 32. Positions 34 to 36 give
the number of strands of the sequence. Positions 37 to 40 give the
topology of molecule sequenced. If the sequence is of a special type,
a notation (such as `circular') is included in positions 43 to 52.

  GenBank sequence entries are divided among fifteen taxonomic
divisions. Each entry's division is identified by a three-letter code
in positions 53 to 55. See Section 3.3 for the division codes.

  Positions 63 to 73 of the record contain the date the entry was
entered or underwent any substantial revisions, such as the addition
of newly published data, in the form dd-MMM-yyyy.

The detailed format for the LOCUS record is as follows:

Positions   	Contents

1-12	LOCUS
13-22	Locus name
23-29	Length of sequence, right-justified
31-32	bp
34-36	Blank, ss- (single-stranded), ds- (double-stranded), or
	 ms- (mixed-stranded)
37-40	Blank, DNA, RNA, tRNA (transfer RNA), rRNA (ribosomal RNA), 
	mRNA (messenger RNA), or uRNA (small nuclear RNA)
43-52	Blank (implies linear) or circular
53-55	The division code (see Section 3.3)
63-73	Date, in the form dd-MMM-yyyy (e.g., 15-MAR-1991)

3.5.5 DEFINITION Format

  The DEFINITION record gives a brief description of the sequence,
proceeding from general to specific. It starts with the common name of
the source organism, then gives the criteria by which this sequence is
distinguished from the remainder of the source genome, such as the
gene name and what it codes for, or the protein name and mRNA, or some
description of the sequence's function (if the sequence is
non-coding). If the sequence has a coding region, the description may
be followed by a completeness qualifier, such as cds (complete coding
sequence). There is no limit on the number of lines that may be part
of the DEFINITION.  The last line must end with a period.

3.5.5.1 DEFINITION Format for NLM Entries

  The DEFINITION line for entries derived from journal-scanning at the NLM is
an automatically generated descriptive summary that accompanies each DNA and
protein sequence. It contains information derived from fields in a database 
that summarize the most important attributes of the sequence.  The DEFINITION
lines are designed to supplement the accession number and the sequence itself
as a means of uniquely and completely specifying DNA and protein sequences. The
following are examples of NLM DEFINITION lines:


NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase [swine, mRNA, 1 gene, 1585 nt]

94 kda fiber cell beaded-filament structural protein [rats, lens, mRNA
Partial, 1 gene, 1873 nt]

inhibin alpha {promoter and exons} [mice, Genomic, 1 gene, 1102 nt, segment
1 of 2]

cefEF, cefG=acetyl coenzyme A:deacetylcephalosporin C o-acetyltransferase
[Acremonium chrysogenum, Genomic, 2 genes, 2639 nt]

myogenic factor 3, qmf3=helix-loop-helix protein [Japanese quails,
embryo, Peptide Partial, 246 aa]


  The first part of the definition line contains information describing
the genes and proteins represented by the molecular sequences.  This can
be gene locus names, protein names and descriptions that replace or augment
actual names.  Gene and gene product are linked by "=".  Any special
identifying terms are presented within brackets, such as: {promoter},
{N-terminal}, {EC 2.13.2.4}, {alternatively spliced}, or {3' region}.

  The second part of the definition line is delimited by square brackets, '[]',
and provides details about the molecule type and length.  The biological
source, i.e., genus and species or common name as cited by the author.
Developmental stage, tissue type and strain are included if available.
The molecule types include: Genomic, mRNA, Peptide. and Other Genomic
Material. Genomic molecules are assumed to be partial sequence unless
"Complete" is specified, whereas mRNA and peptide molecules are assumed
to be complete unless "Partial" is noted.

3.5.6 ACCESSION Format

  This field contains a series of six-character identifiers (accession
numbers: first character a letter, the remainder digits). The primary
(first) accession number occupies positions 13 to 18; subsequent
accession numbers occupy positions 20 to 25, 27 to 32, 34 to 39, 41 to
46, 48 to 53, 55 to 60, 62 to 67, and 69 to 74. No punctuation occurs
between accession numbers or after the final accession number;
accession numbers are separated only by one space.

3.5.7 NID Format

  This field contains the unique nucleic acid sequence identifier that is
assigned by NCBI to the sequence data in a GenBank entry. Nucleic acid
identifiers consist of the letter 'g', followed by one or more digits. This
sequence identifier occupies positions 13 and higher.

  While accession numbers allow one to retrieve the same biological entry
in the database, regardless of changes to that record, the nucleic acid
identifier changes every time that the underlying sequence changes. Reasons
for sequence changes include: the removal of vector contamination, re-sequencing
of stretches of ambiguous sequence, and the correction of sequencing errors.

  At the NCBI, these nucleic acid sequence identifiers are called "gi"
identifiers. In maintaining GenBank, NCBI generates a new gi if a sequence
has changed, and then creates pointers between the old and new gis. Retrieval
of the particular version of a sequence associated with a gi will always be
possible.

3.5.8 KEYWORDS Format

  The KEYWORDS field does not appear in unannotated entries, but is
required in all annotated entries. Keywords are separated by
semicolons; a "keyword" may be a single word or a phrase consisting of
several words. Each line in the keywords field ends in a semicolon;
the last line ends with a period. If no keywords are included in the
entry, the KEYWORDS record contains only a period.

3.5.9 SEGMENT Format

  The SEGMENT keyword is used when two (or more) entries of known
relative orientation are separated by a short (<10 kb) stretch of DNA.
It is limited to one line of the form `n of m', where `n' is the
segment number of the current entry and `m' is the total number of
segments.

3.5.10 SOURCE Format

  The SOURCE field consists of two parts. The first part is found after
the SOURCE keyword and contains free-format information including an
abbreviated form of the organism name followed by a molecule type;
multiple lines are allowed, but the last line must end with a period.
The second part consists of information found after the ORGANISM
subkeyword. The formal scientific name for the source organism (genus
and species, where appropriate) is found on the same line as ORGANISM.
The records following the ORGANISM line list the taxonomic
classification levels, separated by semicolons and ending with a
period.

3.5.11 REFERENCE Format

  The REFERENCE field consists of five parts: the keyword REFERENCE, and
the subkeywords AUTHORS, TITLE (optional), JOURNAL, MEDLINE (optional),
and REMARK (optional).

  The REFERENCE line contains the number of the particular reference and
(in parentheses) the range of bases in the sequence entry reported in
this citation. Additional prose notes may also be found within the
parentheses. The numbering of the references does not reflect
publication dates or priorities.

  The AUTHORS line lists the authors in the order in which they appear
in the cited article. Last names are separated from initials by a
comma (no space); there is no comma before the final `and'. The list
of authors ends with a period.  The TITLE line is an optional field,
although it appears in the majority of entries. It does not appear in
unpublished sequence data entries that have been deposited directly
into the GenBank data bank, the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Library,
or the DNA Data Bank of Japan. The TITLE field does not end with a
period.

  The JOURNAL line gives the appropriate literature citation for the
sequence in the entry. The word `Unpublished' will appear after the
JOURNAL subkeyword if the data did not appear in the scientific
literature, but was directly deposited into the data bank. For
published sequences the JOURNAL line gives the Thesis, Journal, or
Book citation, including the year of publication, the specific
citation, or In press.

  The MEDLINE line provides the National Library of Medicine's Medline
unique identifier for a citation (if known). Medline UIs are 8 digit
numbers.

  The REMARK line is a textual comment that specifies the relevance
of the citation to the entry.

3.5.12 FEATURES Format

  GenBank releases use a feature table format designed jointly by
GenBank, the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Library, and the DNA Data
Bank of Japan. This format is in use by all three databases.

  The feature table contains information about genes and gene products,
as well as regions of biological significance reported in the
sequence. The feature table contains information on regions of the
sequence that code for proteins and RNA molecules. It also enumerates
differences between different reports of the same sequence, and
provides cross-references to other data collections, as described in
more detail below.

  The first line of the feature table is a header that includes the
keyword `FEATURES' and the column header `Location/Qualifier.' Each
feature consists of a descriptor line containing a feature key and a
location (see sections below for details). If the location does not
fit on this line, a continuation line may follow. If further
information about the feature is required, one or more lines
containing feature qualifiers may follow the descriptor line.

  The feature key begins in column 6 and may be no more than 15
characters in length. The location begins in column 22. Feature
qualifiers begin on subsequent lines at column 22. Location,
qualifier, and continuation lines may extend from column 22 to 80.

  Feature tables are optional. However, a feature table must include one
header line and at least one feature descriptor line.

  The sections below provide a brief introduction to the new feature
table format. For a thorough description of the feature table
format, see the document `The DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank Feature Table:
Definition.' If you would like a copy of this publication, contact
GenBank at the address shown on the first page of these Release Notes.

3.5.12.2 Feature Location

  The second column of the feature descriptor line designates the
location of the feature in the sequence. The location descriptor
begins at position 22. Several conventions are used to indicate
sequence location.

  Base numbers in location descriptors refer to numbering in the entry,
which is not necessarily the same as the numbering scheme used in the
published report. The first base in the presented sequence is numbered
base 1. Sequences are presented in the 5 to 3 direction.

Location descriptors can be one of the following:

1. A single base;

2. A contiguous span of bases;

3. A site between two bases;

4. A single base chosen from a range of bases;

5. A single base chosen from among two or more specified bases;

6. A joining of sequence spans;

7. A reference to an entry other than the one to which the feature
belongs (i.e., a remote entry), followed by a location descriptor
referring to the remote sequence;

8. A literal sequence (a string of bases enclosed in quotation marks).

  A site between two residues, such as an endonuclease cleavage site, is
indicated by listing the two bases separated by a carat (e.g., 23^24).

  A single residue chosen from a range of residues is indicated by the
number of the first and last bases in the range separated by a single
period (e.g., 23.79). The symbols < and > indicate that the end point
of the range is beyond the specified base number.

  A contiguous span of bases is indicated by the number of the first and
last bases in the range separated by two periods (e.g., 23..79). The
symbols < and > indicate that the end point of the range is beyond the
specified base number. Starting and ending positions can be indicated
by base number or by one of the operators described below.

  Operators are prefixes that specify what must be done to the indicated
sequence to locate the feature. The following are the operators
available, along with their most common format and a description.

complement (location): The feature is complementary to the location
indicated. Complementary strands are read 5 to 3.

join (location, location, .. location): The indicated elements should
be placed end to end to form one contiguous sequence.

order (location, location, .. location): The elements are found in the
specified order in the 5 to 3 direction, but nothing is implied about
the rationality of joining them.

group (location, location, .. location): The elements are related and
should be grouped together, but no order is implied.

one-of (location, location, .. location): The element can be any one,
but only one, of the items listed.

replace (location, location): The first location indicated should be
replaced by the sequence from the second location; used for
insertions, deletions, and variants.

3.5.12.3  Feature Qualifiers

  Qualifiers provide additional information about features. They take
the form of a slash (/) followed by a qualifier name and, if
applicable, an equal sign (=) and a qualifier value. Feature
qualifiers begin at column 22.

Qualifiers convey many types of information. Their values can,
therefore, take several forms:

1. Free text;
2. Controlled vocabulary or enumerated values;
3. Citations or reference numbers;
4. Sequences;
5. Feature labels.

  Text qualifier values must be enclosed in double quotation marks. The
text can consist of any printable characters (ASCII values 32-126
decimal). If the text string includes double quotation marks, each set
must be `escaped' by placing a double quotation mark in front of it
(e.g., /note="This is an example of ""escaped"" quotation marks").

  Some qualifiers require values selected from a limited set of choices.
For example, the `/direction' qualifier has only three values `left,'
`right,' or `both.' These are called controlled vocabulary qualifier
values. Controlled qualifier values are not case sensitive; they can
be entered in any combination of upper- and lowercase without changing
their meaning.

  Citation or published reference numbers for the entry should be
enclosed in square brackets ([]) to distinguish them from other
numbers.

  A literal sequence of bases (e.g., "atgcatt") should be enclosed in
quotation marks. Literal sequences are distinguished from free text by
context. Qualifiers that take free text as their values do not take
literal sequences, and vice versa.

  The `/label=' qualifier takes a feature label as its qualifier.
Although feature labels are optional, they allow unambiguous
references to the feature. The feature label identifies a feature
within an entry; when combined with the accession number and the name
of the data bank from which it came, it is a unique tag for that
feature. Feature labels must be unique within an entry, but can be the
same as a feature label in another entry. Feature labels are not case
sensitive; they can be entered in any combination of upper-and
lowercase without changing their meaning.

The following is a list of valid feature qualifiers.

/anticodon	Location of the anticodon of tRNA and the amino acid
for which it codes

/bound_moiety	Moiety bound

/citation	Reference to a citation providing the claim of or
evidence for a feature

/codon		Specifies a codon that is different from any found in the
reference genetic code

/codon_start	Indicates the first base of the first complete codon
in a CDS (as 1 or 2 or 3)

/cons_splice	Identifies intron splice sites that do not conform to
the 5'-GT... AG-3' splice site consensus

/db_xref	A database cross-reference; pointer to related information
in another database

/direction	Direction of DNA replication

/EC_number	Enzyme Commission number for the enzyme product of the
sequence

/evidence	Value indicating the nature of supporting evidence

/frequency	Frequency of the occurrence of a feature

/function	Function attributed to a sequence

/gene		Symbol of the gene corresponding to a sequence region (usable
with all features)

/label		A label used to permanently identify a feature

/map		Map position of the feature in free-format text

/mod_base	Abbreviation for a modified nucleotide base

/note		Any comment or additional information

/number		A number indicating the order of genetic elements
(e.g., exons or introns) in the 5 to 3 direction

/organism	Name of organism if different from that contained in
the entry's ORGANISM field

/partial	Differentiates between complete regions and partial ones

/phenotype	Phenotype conferred by the feature

/product	Name of a product encoded by the sequence

/pseudo		Indicates that this feature is a non-functional
version of the element named by the feature key

/rpt_family	Type of repeated sequence; Alu or Kpn, for example

/rpt_type	Organization of repeated sequence

/rpt_unit	Identity of repeat unit that constitutes a repeat_region

/standard_name	Accepted standard name for this feature

/transl_except	Translational exception: single codon, the translation
of which does not conform to the reference genetic code

/translation	Amino acid translation of coding region (automatically
generated)

/type		Name of a strain if different from that in the SOURCE field

/usedin		Indicates that feature is used in a compound feature
in another entry

3.5.12.4 Cross-Reference Information

  One type of information in the feature table lists cross-references to
the annual compilation of transfer RNA sequences in Nucleic Acids
Research, which has kindly been sent to us on CD-ROM by Dr. Sprinzl.
Each tRNA entry of the feature table contains a /note= qualifier that
includes a reference such as `(NAR: 1234)' to identify code 1234 in
the NAR compilation. When such a cross-reference appears in an entry
that contains a gene coding for a transfer RNA molecule, it refers to
the code in the tRNA gene compilation. Similar cross-references in
entries containing mature transfer RNA sequences refer to the
companion compilation of tRNA sequences published by D.H. Gauss and M.
Sprinzl in Nucleic Acids Research.

3.5.12.5 Feature Table Examples

  In the first example a number of key names, feature locations, and
qualifiers are illustrated, taken from different sequences. The first
table entry is a coding region consisting of a simple span of bases
and including a /gene qualifier. In the second table entry, an NAR
cross-reference is given (see the previous section for a discussion of
these cross-references). The third and fourth table entries use the
symbols `<`and `>' to indicate that the beginning or end of the
feature is beyond the range of the presented sequence. In the fifth
table entry, the symbol `^' indicates that the feature is between
bases. In the sixth table entry, the replace operator is shown.

Example 11. Joining Sequences


3.5.13 ORIGIN Format

  The ORIGIN record may be left blank, may appear as `Unreported.' or
may give a local pointer to the sequence start, usually involving an
experimentally determined restriction cleavage site or the genetic
locus (if available). The ORIGIN record ends in a period if it
contains data, but does not include the period if the record is left
empty (in contrast to the KEYWORDS field which contains a period
rather than being left blank).

3.5.14 SEQUENCE Format

  The nucleotide sequence for an entry is found in the records following
the ORIGIN record. The sequence is reported in the 5 to 3 direction.
There are sixty bases per record, listed in groups of ten bases
followed by a blank, starting at position 11 of each record. The
number of the first nucleotide in the record is given in columns 4 to
9 (right justified) of the record.


4. ALTERNATE RELEASES

  NCBI is supplying sequence data in the GenBank flat file format to
maintain compatibility with existing software which require that
particular format.  Although we have made every effort to ensure
that these data are presented in the traditional flat file format,
if you encounter any problems in using these data with software which
is based upon the flat file format, please contact us at:

              info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

  The flat file is just one of many possible report formats that can be
generated from the richer representation supported by the ASN.1 form of the
data.  Developers of new software tools should consider using the ASN.1 form
directly to take advantage of those features.  Documentation and a Software
Developer's Toolkit for ASN.1 are available through NCBI.  You may call NCBI
at (301)496-2475, or subscribe to a developers' electronic newsgroup by
sending your name, address, affiliation, and e-mail address to:

              bits-request@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

  The Software Developer's Toolkit and PostScript documentation for UNIX,
VMS, Ultrix, AIX, MacOS, DOS, and Microsoft Windows systems is available
in a compressed UNIX tar file by anonymous ftp from 'ncbi.nlm.nih.gov',
in the toolbox/ncbi_tools directory. The file is 'ncbi.tar.Z'.


5. KNOWN PROBLEMS OF THE GENBANK DATABASE

5.1 Incorrect Gene Symbols in Entries and Index

  The /gene qualifier for many GenBank entries contains values other than the
official gene symbol, such as the product or the standard name of the gene. The
gene symbol index (gbgen.idx) is created from the data in the /gene qualifier
and therefore may contain data other than official gene symbols.


6. GENBANK ADMINISTRATION 

  The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), National Library
of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, is responsible for the production
and distribution of the NIH GenBank Sequence Database.  NCBI distributes
GenBank sequence data by CD-ROM, anonymous FTP, e-mail servers and other
network services.  For more information, you may contact NCBI at the
e-mail address:  info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov  or by phone: 301-496-2475.

6.1 Registered Trademark Notice

  GenBank (R) is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services for the Genetic Sequence Data Bank.

6.2 Citing GenBank

  If you have used GenBank in your research, we would appreciate it if
you would include a reference to GenBank in all publications related
to that research.

  When citing data in GenBank, it is appropriate to give the sequence
name, primary accession number, and the publication in which the
sequence first appeared. If the data are unpublished, we urge you to
contact the group which submitted the data to GenBank to see if there
is a recent publication or if they have determined any revisions or
extensions of the data.

  It is also appropriate to list a reference for GenBank itself. The
following publication, which describes the GenBank database, should
be cited:

	Benson, D., Boguski, M., Lipman, D.J., and Ostell, J. GenBank.
	Nucl. Acids Res. 24(1):1-5 (1996)

  The following statement is an example of how you may cite GenBank
data. It cites the sequence, its primary accession number, the group
who determined the sequence, and GenBank. The numbers in brackets
refer to one of the GenBank citations above and the REFERENCE in the
GenBank sequence entry.

`We scanned the GenBank (1) data bank for sequence similarities and
found one sequence (2), GenBank accession number J01016, which showed
significant similarity...'

(1) Benson, D. et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 24(1):1-5 (1996)
(2) Nellen, W. and Gallwitz, D. J. Mol. Biol. 159, 1-18 (1982)

6.3 GenBank Distribution Formats and Media

  GenBank data are available on industry-standard ISO-9660 CD-ROM.
The standard flat file format is included.  

  This documentation accompanies the five CD-ROM set entitled 'GenBank (Flat
File Format)'.  Each release is cumulative, incorporating all previous GenBank
data. No retrieval software is provided.

6.4 Other CD-ROM Titles

Entrez CDROM release to be discontinued:

Entrez is a molecular biology database system that presents an integrated
view of DNA and protein sequence data, 3D structure data, and associated
MEDLINE entries. The system is produced by the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and is available over the Internet and 
previously on CD-ROM.

However, due to the continuing rapid growth in size of GenBank and other
sequence databases, the CD-ROM version of Entrez is becoming
increasingly unwieldy and inconvenient. The CD-ROM version has lagged
far behind the two Internet versions, Network Entrez and Web Entrez, in
the number of MEDLINE citations available and in the addition of new
databases, including the Genomes division and the Structure division,
as well as links to an increasing number of on-line journals.  In
addition, the two on-line versions of Entrez are now updated daily,
compared to the bimonthly CD-ROM updates.

Therefore NCBI has decided to discontinue the publication of Entrez
on CD-ROM.  The last release of the Entrez on CD-ROM  will be on August
15, 1996 and new orders and renewals are no longer being accepted. Entrez 
is now available only through Internet access. 

Access to the Internet versions of Entrez is easy.  If you have a World
Wide Web browser, such as Netscape or Mosaic, simply point your browser
to http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/.  The Web version of Entrez has all the
capabilities of the CD-ROM version, but with the visual style of the
World Wide Web.  If you preferred the "look and feel" of the CD-ROM
version, you may download Network Entrez from the NCBI's anonymous FTP
site:  ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.  Versions are available for PC/Windows,
Macintosh and several Unix workstations.

For information about Network Entrez, Web Entrez or any other NCBI
services, you may contact NCBI by e-mail to info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov or by
phone at 301-496-2475.
