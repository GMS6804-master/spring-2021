# GMS6804 Spring 2023, Translational Bioinformatics

## Course Description
This course will cover translational bioinformatics in the context of human diseases. Students will be provided with the practical skills to implement what they have learned in class. Specifically, when the course is finished, students will be able to analyze multi-omics data to understand human disease. The objective of this course is expose students to the topics and technologies used in modern bioinformatics studies. The course covers a mix of biological and computational topics, including:
- Genetic variation and Genome-Wide Association Studies
- Current high throughput sequencing assays (DNA-Seq, RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq)
- Differential gene expression techniques
- Microbiome/metagenomics techniques
- Metabolomics
- Proteomics
- Systems, network, and integrative biology
- Basic linux cluster usage
- Python and R scripting
- Computational workflow and replication strategies
- Genomics data visualization techniques
- Biological databases

## Office Hours
* by appointment only. 

## Homework
* You will get a homework every Thursday.
* The expected level of homework is that whoever attended and followed well on the Thursday hands-on course should be able to answer the homework questions in a few hours.
* Homework is due by the following Friday at midnight (11:59 pm).
* Turn in the homework to CANVAS.
* Show all codes with answers to the questions.

## Final Exam
* Create a hands-on session document to perform data analysis with your own data (public or private data) similar to MED 263 class
* Following this document, students (or others) should be able to conduct a data analysis in the context of bioinformatics
* Turn in the hands-on session document to TA (affaustino@ucsd.edu) prior to the last class (deadline  11:59 pm Sunday March 18, 2018)
* Present the hands-on session during the class Thursday March 8, 2018 (10-minute presetation each)
